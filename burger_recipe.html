<section class="main-section" id="Burger_Patty">
    <header class="header_burger">Burger Patty</header>
    <p>When it comes to the burger patty, it's better to look out for something vegan. If you do that you can get 
        a very reliable source of protein that actually taste like a real burger. Some people prefer to make a burger patty
         out of beans, lentils or chickpeas. If you are would rather have a legumes burger istead, that's totally fine 
         even though, it will not taste like a real burger anymore.
    </p>
    <p class="list">My best options are:
       <div class="code_list"><ul>
            <li>Verdino Veggie Burger</li>
            <li>Beyond Meat</li>
            <li>Impossible Burger</li>
        </ul></div>
    </p>
    <p>Choose the best one for you.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="Burger_Bun">
    <header class="header_burger">Burger Bun</header>
    <p>Not much to say about burger buns. Except that they are also as important as the rest of the ingredients.</p>
    <p>Feel free to choose the ones that suit you best, based on your preferences.</p>
    <p>What to look after when you are choosing your burger bun:</p>
    <ul><li>Color:
         <code class="highlights">Make sure is very well done by looking at the color. Is should have a golden shade.</code></li>
        <li>Texture:<code class="highlights">It should look very fluffy</code></li>
        <li>Nutrition factors:<code class="highlights">proteins, carbs and sugars are very important.</code></li>
        <li>Condition:<code class="highlights">make sure it is as fresh as possible</code></li></ul>

<section class="main-section" id="Burger_Veggies">
    <header class="header_burger">Burger Veggies</header>
    <p>Moving on to my favorite parts: The vegetables</p>
    <p>Vegetables can make a huge difference between an average burger, or a unforgateble one.</p>
    <p>For this part you can choose some tomato, saut√©ed onions, pickles, and very important, some fresh green 
        slightly crunchy letuce.
    </p>

    <p>for assembling your burger, make sure that the vegan patty is well done. You can also add the bun to a pan for a minute or two, to give it a beautiful golder color.</p>
    <p>Next, place the patty at the base of your burger when it is still hot, so that when you place the cheese on top of it, it will melt.
        Moving on to the veggies. Make sure that they are clean and that they are cutted in a pretty way.
        Then you add your 1000 island sauce and there you go! Enjoy your vegan burger.
